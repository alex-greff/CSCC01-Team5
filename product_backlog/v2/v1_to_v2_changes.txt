Personas:
- No changes

User Stories:
- Removed U10 and U11 because after some discussion the team decided that implementing graphical template editors is beyond the scope of the project

Tasks:
- Updated the tasks to reflect the changes made in the user stories.
- Added an extra task (which is now T9) because we realized that we missed this necessary task in ealier versions.
- Consolidated the T10 and T11 into one task.
- Re-did T10 and T11 to better match the report system that was built (the conceptual report system turned out to be a bit different to the implemented version).
- Lowered the story points for T13 from 4 to 3 because Won (who is completing it) thinks it will only take that long.
